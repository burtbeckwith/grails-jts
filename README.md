Grails Plugin for JTS integration
==========

This plugin provides topology operations support for Grails application provided by JTS, an API of 2D spatial predicates and functions developed by Vivid Solutions, Inc.

With this plugin you can create instances of `Point`, `Triangle`, `Polygon` and almost any `Geometry` you need for your application.

Also, you can perform spacial analysis operations like union, intersection or difference.

The most common use case is defining a `Polygon` representing an area of the map and then checking if some `Point` is within or without that area by providing its coordinates.

Please check the JTS JavaDoc [here](http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/javadoc/index.html)

For more information about JTS in general, please visit its main page [here](http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/JTSHome.htm)

As a start, I've created a `Service` with a single method for creating a `Point` from a pair of coordinates. You should use it like this:

```groovy
class YourService {

	def jtsService

	def yourMethod() {

		// code before getting the Point

		Double latitude = -34.906485
    	Double longitude = -56.199747

    	Point p = jtsService.createPoint(latitude, longitude)

		// code after getting the Point

	}

}
```

I will be adding more functionality as soon as possible.
